# Progress-tracker

Tom &amp; Adrià’s Progress Tracker – This repository contains structured notes and task breakdowns for ongoing research and simulation work using FESTIM/HISP/PFC-Tritium-Transport in order to assess long-term tritium retention in ITER's PFC. 

In these two files I will document the last updates or progress made in current tasks/projects and the tasks that are yet to do (which will be yet to start or without significant progress to be documented):

**Last updates:** [Progress-tracker/Tritium inventory in PFC/Last updates (ongoing or done tasks).md at main · AdriaLlealS/Progress-tracker](https://github.com/AdriaLlealS/Progress-tracker/blob/main/Tritium%20inventory%20in%20PFC/Last%20updates%20\(ongoing%20or%20done%20tasks\).md)

**To do list:**  [Progress-tracker/Tritium inventory in PFC/To do.md at main · AdriaLlealS/Progress-tracker](https://github.com/AdriaLlealS/Progress-tracker/blob/main/Tritium%20inventory%20in%20PFC/To%20do.md)
