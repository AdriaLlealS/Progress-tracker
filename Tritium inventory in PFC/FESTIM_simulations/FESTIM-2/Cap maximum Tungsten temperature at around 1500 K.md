· **Current Temperature model for tungsten leads to surface temperatures over 2200 K for heat loads of $10 \hspace{2mm} MW/m^2$. This value exceeds the maximum expected temperatures reached in ITER's PFC. **

o   Progress: Ongoing

o   Comments: We want to keep the ramp-up and ramp-down times of the surface temperature as much as possible, since the difference between the shapes of heat-load and particle flux has a high impact in hydrogen implantation. Therefore, some kind of smoothening of the Temperature needs to be implemented when reaching its maximum value.
