·   **Find out where does the small discrepancy between the input implantation flux and the derived one come from**

o   Progress: Done

o   Comments: FESTIM calculates the implantation flux at each point of the volume according to the specified normal distribution. Its tail outside the material is “lost” and not contributing to the implantation. I should check data as well for implantation ranges and widths as well as material constants.
