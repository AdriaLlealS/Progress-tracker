·  **Simulate 100 pulses as I’m doing right now and then simulate with boundary condition of maximum surface or pre-bulk concentration .**

o   Progress: Done

o   Comments: Simulations with this boundary condition are indeed more computationally efficient and gets rid of troubles when running simulations with coarser meshes. Simulations with this BC and the previous mesh are indeed faster, but with coarser meshes they take from ½ to 1/3 of the original time. However, significant error in the bulk inventory is introduced.
