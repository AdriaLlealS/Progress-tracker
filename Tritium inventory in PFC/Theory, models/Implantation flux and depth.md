·    **Think about how implantation flux (its value, implantation depth and width) depends on plasma current and heat loads**

o   Progress: Yet to start

o   Comments: For now, we are assuming linear dependency between implantation flux and heat loads. Also, implantation depth and width are considered constant for the different scenarios and times.
