· **Rethink about the equations that describe Temperature in the Tungsten slabs or their ranges of valid heat loads**

o   Progress: Ongoing

o   Comments: The current equations describing the linear T profile show the T profile in a steady state. Therefore, should be valid during the peak of heat flux (or during the most significant part of it). However, during the fast ramp-up and ramp-down (where T and particle fluxes are rapidly changing and altering the inventory) this assumption might not be valid. I am trying to use FESTIM’s heat equation solver to obtain the T profiles during ramp-up and ramp-down.
